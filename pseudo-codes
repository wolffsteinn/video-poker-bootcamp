Just thinking about the replacing of cards

- cards will be replaced directly into the array?
- meaning card[2] chosen so the new card will replace that card at that position right?
- but how to ensure that it does that?

Conditions for winning:
==== THINK OF HOW TO INCORPORATE TALLY FUNCTIONS ====

1. Jacks or Better (done)

   - rankCounter = 11 | 12 | 13
   - strictly 2 cards of either ranks

2. Two Pairs (done)

   - Can use a for loop?
   - can this be coupled with Jacks or Better?

3. Three of a Kind (done)

   - Loop through the array and find if got three of the same ranked cards
   - use a counter to keep track of how many cards of the same rank? like the tic tac toe result validation

4. Four of a kind (done)

   - same as three of a kind, just that now is 4 cards of the same rank

   5. Straight (done except high card ace straight hand)

   - Rank of the cards are of a difference of 1
   - exception: 10 | J | Q | K | A
     - Hence need to have a if statement on when rankCounter = 1

5. Flush (done)

   - all cards have the same suit

6. Full House (done)

   - Three of a Kind + One pair (any rank is possible)
   - maybe this can be a subset under Three of a Kind. would have an if statement for Full house in the Three of a Kind function.

7. Straight Flush (done)

   - combination of flush and straight

8. Royal Flush (done)
   - 10 | J | Q | K | A same suit.
   - so i suppose royal Flush is a subset of Straight Flush and hence, would have an if statement for royal flush in the Straight flush function.

- empty that position of array and pop the card out?


some ideas for restarting the game:
when the winning conditions are calculated, immediately execute setTimeout function
--- Next round in (insert the setTimeout function here so that the countdown blinks to 0)
--- also have a button where they can just immediately click reset
